# Reservation Management Plugin

The Reservation Management Plugin is a plugin for Netbox that simplifies the reservation process. With the plugin, users can create reservations that have a contact person, a team, and a time frame. The plugin also introduces the concept of claims, which are used to associate reservations with exclusive or shared tags.
